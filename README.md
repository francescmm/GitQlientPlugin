# GitQlientPlugin
GitQlientPlugin is the project to build and integrated a QtCreator plugin of GitQlient

## Installing the plugin
You can find the plugin in the [release section](https://github.com/francescmm/GitQlientPlugin/releases). Once you have downloaded the plugin, copy it into the QtCreator folder where Qt is installed (Qt/Tools/QtCreator/lib/qtcreator/plugins) or in the following folders:

Linux
``~/.local/share/data/QtProject/qtcreator/plugins/<version>``

Windows
``%LOCALAPPDATA%\QtProject\qtcreator\plugins\<version>``

OSX
``~/Library/Application Support/QtProject/Qt Creator/plugins/<version>``

You need to replace <version> with the QtCreator version (e.g. 4.10.2).

The plugin should be activated by default once you have copied it, so you just will need to reboot QtCreator.
